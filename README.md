# z-control IONIC Setup

The z-control IONIC Setup app is a starter template and utility for building Ionic applications within the z-control ecosystem. It provides a structured foundation with built-in features like quota management, tab-based navigation, and comprehensive documentation to help developers quickly create and deploy their own Ionic apps.

## Features

- **Quota management**: Track and display API usage with clear quota limits and warnings
- **Tab-based navigation**: Clean, intuitive UI with separate tabs for main feature and settings
- **Built-in help**: Help page for step-by-step instructions and FAQs
- **Structure for Settings**: Dedicated settings tab with accordions for configuration, Feedback, Change-log, Privacy Policy, and support

The online demo uses the free Datamuse API, allowing you to test quota management and application features without setting up your own backend environment.

**Android Application**

The Android app is **available only to the z-control team in Google Play Internal Test Group** for testing and validation purposes, as it is used to create new applications based on this setup. It is not intended for public distribution.

## Development Workflow

Use this workflow when you build a new feature for another z-control app (for example translator) that needs backend changes.

1. Implement backend changes in z-control Backend Functions repository and deploy them from there.
2. Start Firebase emulators from this setup repository.
3. Run the target frontend app (for example translator) with `ionic serve`.
4. Test FE and BE integration against the Firebase emulator.
5. Deploy shared Firebase Functions from the z-control Backend Functions repository only.
6. Deploy the target frontend app after integration tests pass.

Why this works:

- Shared backend stays in one source of truth.
- Function deployments remain safe and predictable.
- Frontend repos can evolve independently without backend deployment ownership.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android builds)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zoechbauer/z-control-ionic-setup
cd z-control-ionic-setup
npm install
ionic serve
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.

### Testing

#### Frontend Tests (Karma + Jasmine)

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (recommended for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with code coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
#### Backend Tests (Vitest + Istanbul)

See z-control Backend Functions repository documentation for backend testing instructions, as the backend code and tests are maintained there.

### Building for Android

```bash
ionic build --prod
npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew buildRelease
```
